# Application for Bilingual FastAPI Backend Developer Position
## Mandarin Blueprint - Flask to FastAPI Migration

### Executive Summary

I am submitting my application for the Backend Developer position focused on migrating Mandarin Blueprint's Flask application to FastAPI. This MVP package demonstrates my technical capabilities and approach to the migration project.

### Why I'm a Strong Fit

**Technical Expertise:**
- **Python Backend (Self-Taught)**: FastAPI, Flask, Pydantic, async/await
- **Java/Spring Boot Background**: 1 years REST API development, JWT/PostgreSQL experience directly transferable to FastAPI
- **Web Fundamentals**: HTTP, session management, ORM patterns (SQLAlchemy/Spring Data), 

**Bilingual Capabilities:**
- Professional fluency in English and i am *native speaker of Mandarin*
- Understanding of language learning methodologies and SRS systems

**Migration Philosophy:**
- Methodical, test-driven approach ensuring feature parity
- Incremental migration strategy minimizing risk
- Comprehensive documentation throughout the process

### My Approach to This Migration

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Week 1-2)
- Complete audit of existing Flask codebase
- Map all blueprints, routes, and dependencies
- Identify authentication patterns and session management
- Document database schema and Supabase integration points
- Create detailed migration roadmap with milestones

#### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 3-4)
- Set up FastAPI project structure
- Implement JWT authentication system
- Configure Supabase connection pool
- Create base middleware and dependency injection
- Set up comprehensive testing framework

#### Phase 3: Route Migration (Week 5-10)
- Convert Flask blueprints to FastAPI routers systematically:
  - Authentication & user management
  - Course content management
  - Character & sentence modules
  - Review system & spaced repetition
  - Public API endpoints
  - PWA backend support
- Parallel running: Flask and FastAPI side-by-side
- Progressive testing with real data

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 11-12)
- End-to-end testing of all features
- Performance benchmarking
- Security audit
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation completion

#### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (Week 13-14)
- Staged rollout strategy
- Monitoring setup
- Rollback procedures
- Final cutover

### Technical Demonstration

This MVP package includes:

1. **Sample Migration Code**: A demonstration showing Flask blueprint conversion to FastAPI router
2. **Authentication System**: JWT implementation compatible with Supabase
3. **Database Integration**: Connection pooling and query examples
4. **Testing Suite**: Pytest examples showing migration testing approach
5. **Documentation**: API documentation using FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation

### Value Proposition

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Parallel running during transition
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Rollback procedures at every stage
- Daily progress reports
- Weekly milestone reviews
